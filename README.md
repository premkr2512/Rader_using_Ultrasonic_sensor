# Rader_using_Ultrasonic_sensor

I am using NOdeMcu  as Controller to control all the module connected to it.
In this project I am going to use Ultrasonic sensor to scan objects/Obstacle around it surrounding.
Adafruit and Mqtt is used as a broker to communicate wirelessly.
servo moter is usedto move my ultrasonic sensor to track all obstacle around 180 degree.
